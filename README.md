This NodeJS script parses patch names from DX7 sysex dumps and lets you explore them in a browser.

# Usage

Copy all the files (listpatches.js, execute.bat and template.html) to the root directory of your DX7 patch library and run execute.bat. After this you can open the generated patch-explorer.html in your browser. You can search patches by name or explore them by directory. Click on a patch to get information about how to load the patch to your favourite DX7 emulator.
